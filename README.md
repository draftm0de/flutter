# DraftMode Flutter Facade

This repository only provides wrapper packages that surface DraftMode functionality under the `package:draftmode/...` namespace so app code can depend on a single facade.

## Wrapped Packages
- [draftmode_worker](https://github.com/draftm0de/flutter.worker) — background-task helper that exposes `DraftModeWorker` and `DraftModeWorkerEvents` for starting, cancelling, and observing timer-driven work.

For implementation details, platform notes, and sample apps, follow the linked package repositories.
